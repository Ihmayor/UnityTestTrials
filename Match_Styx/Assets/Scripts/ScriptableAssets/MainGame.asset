  PaperDialogue:
  - "It's great to see you've started to venture out again. \nWe know it's been hard
    leaving camp lately. \n\n Do try to find us, head east. Good luck."
  - "I know it's freezing out there but you've got the tools to survive, I believe
    in you. Breathe.\n\n Don't forget to 'E' for warmth, if you've got the reserves
    for it."
  - Look, you can't give up. You just can't.
  - "It's okay to take breaks but you can't sleep forever. \n\nFind us."
  - I promise you that there's a greater world out there, waiting for you. You just
    have to keep trying, keep working at it.
  - I know you want to just sleep the days away until it's long gone. I know you
    don't want to move anymore. I don't what to say to you anymore.
  - Do you really want someone ELSE to dictate the narrative? If you know that they'll
    never understand you in life, what more in your death?
  - 'I promise it''s not all snow out here. I promise. '
  - Keep going.
  JournalPage:
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I hope that I won''t write in you too much. Otherwise, that
    would mean I barely tried to leave.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I feel a sense of urgency beckoning me, but it''s a pull
    that''s vague enough to ignore, like a banshee but muffled to a whisper. I''m
    aware of her screams but the warm fire can easily drown her out.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I''m thinking about giving up. I know I shouldn''t but I
    can''t help it.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I think they''re lying to me. I think they want me to believe
    that there''s something out there, out east, but I hardly see the point in venturing
    so far. '
  - 'Dear Journal,


    Looks like I have failed. I said I wouldn''t rely on you
    too much but here I am. On the fourth day.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I''m telling myself it''s recuperation. I know that''s a
    lie.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    What am I even doing out here? Isn''t it all pointless anyways?'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I suppose if I truly wanted to give up, I wouldn''t keep
    trying to venture out even if instigating the action is like pullling teeth.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I have a plan. I finally have a plan.'
  - 'Dear Journal,


    I can feel the calm settle over me. It''ll be over soon.'
  - "Dear Journal,\n\nThank you for being here...before I go. It's ok. You'll be
    fine. \n\nGoodbye."
